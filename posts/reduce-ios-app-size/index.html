I remember the time when Blender a full-featured 3d editing program that rivals the industry standard Maya had at one time been able to fit on a couple of floppy disks. This was a point of pride for them that they had keeped the code in check and were careful to add external dependencies that would inevitably cause bloat and an increased install size.</p><p>App-Clips were another motivation, with my original intent to get my application Dented Nails under 10mb. Then I wondered why my app which is almost 100% code should be over 10mb at all, I started to dig into where the extra space was coming from.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/first">first</a></li><li><a href="/tags/article">article</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
